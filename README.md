## Advanced Algorithms Lab Sessions

This repository contains all the lab sessions and practical exercises for the Advanced Algorithms course. Each folder is organized by topic and includes Python implementations of various algorithms and data structures covered throughout the semester.

### Structure

- **Backtracking/**: Solutions to backtracking problems (e.g., N-Queen problem).
- **Divide_Conquer/**: Sorting algorithms and other divide and conquer techniques (e.g., Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, Bucket Sort, Insertion Sort, Radix Sort).
- **Lessons/**: Core data structures and algorithm lessons (e.g., linked lists, queues, stacks, infix to postfix conversion, LRU caching).
- **Queue/**: Queue data structure implementation.
- **Stacks/**: Stack data structure and related algorithms (e.g., infix to prefix/postfix, scientific calculator).
- **Tasks/**: Additional algorithmic tasks and problems (e.g., closest pair, greedy algorithms, min-max array, power of n).
